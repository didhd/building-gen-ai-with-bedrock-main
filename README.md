# Building Generative AI Applications with Amazon Bedrock

Welcome to our immersive workshop on building generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock. This hands-on session is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills to leverage foundation models for a broad spectrum of tasks.

Our learning objectives are:

1. To build a Streamlit application capable of displaying images produced via Stable Diffusion.

2. To create an AI Agent with the capability to generate code and retrieve information from documents.

3. To understand the process of fine-tuning a foundation model for stylized responses.

By the end of this workshop, you will have gained valuable hands-on experience in building generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock.

This is a 300-level workshop, so familiarly with Python and using the terminal is helpful. No AI/ML experience is necessary. This workshop is intended to be finished within 2 hours.
